## Meteor todos on Sandstorm

This repository contains a simple todo app, made with Meteor.

It comes from `meteor create --example todos` with slight changes for
Sandstorm. You can see those changes by reading the git log.

Once it's on the [Sandstorm app market](https://apps.sandstorm.io) you
can click a button to start using it.

## How we use branches

The **master** branch contains the latest version.

That's the only branch for now.

There is **no special Sandstorm packaging branch** because this app is
packaged via `vagrant-spk` with the packaging work done on master.
